# Educational Technology Plan

My educational technology plan covers a high school elective course I plan on teaching next school year.  As a high school chemistry teacher with professional science experience, I know that computer science skills are highly desired in the workplace.  This course is introductory and based on CA's computer science standards, under a theme of professional STEM careers.  Problem-based instruction, collaborative group work, and inquiry-based instruction, will be the primary pedagogies applied by the instructor.


## Context

### Course

Scientific Programming, a two-semester elective course for grades 10-12, allows students to incorporate essential computer science and programming skills into the laboratory in order to become more competitive in the scientific marketplace.  Students will begin by learning fundamental computer science concepts, while using Scratch, before being introduced to commonly-used programming languages.  The class will then focus on MATLAB as the primary language for scientific research.

### Situation

Scientific Programming will align with Computer Science Standards for Public Schools.  This elective course will be for a class size of 25, and for grades 10-12.  Student demographics of note include 75% Latino and 50% economically disadvantaged.  Scaffolds and differentiation will be present for students with learning disabilities and/or EL qualifications.  This Title I high school is in a rural town, meaning technical accessibility issues may be present; however, all students will have access to a Chromebook.  Class period lengths are about 50 minutes, 5 days a week.


## Plan

### Software Specifications

For the operating system, we will use Microsoft Windows, as the school currently has this software available for students.  The learning management system (LMS) will be Canvas, as this is LMS used currently in other classes at the high school.  The web browser will be Google Chrome.  For antivirus software, Chromebooks will have Windows Defender installed.  Microsoft Office 365, which is already on the Chromebooks, will be used for the document processing software.  Archive utilities software will be WinZip.  Visual Studio Code will be installed on all computers, so that students can use MATLAB.  Microsoft Developer will be the developer software.  Online/web services used will include scratch.mit.edu, github.com, and w3schools.com.  Windows has a built-in SSH through Windows Terminal.  Microsoft Family Safety will be used to limit access to school-appropriate websites.  Students also will have access to G Suite, and Google Classroom will be used daily for posting resources, rubrics, and assignments.  Aeries will be used to input grades and communicate to parent/guardians via ParentSquare.

### Application

In-class activities include a Daily Do Now, which is a brief, introductory problem set used to activate prior knowledge.  These take no more than 10 minutes, including discussing the answers as a class.  Students will then receive direct instruction related to the learning goal of the lesson, and this should not take more than 15 minutes.  The purpose of the direct instruction is to model new concepts, review old concepts, and explain directions for the daily assignment.  The remainder of the period will be used to complete the daily assignment.  If students do not finish, then it is expected to be completed for homework.  Resources, such as slideshows, models, past lectures, tutorials, and translations will be posted via Google Classroom, and it is encouraged that students use them during the class period.  These resources will support students via the essentials of Dual-Learning Theory.  This daily strategy allows for formative assessments while students complete activities.  It also complements Cognitive Load Theory, as direct instructional time is kept to a minimum so that students can focus on germane load, and the instructor can remove extraneous load.  The Coherence Principle will be addressed through each facet of the lesson plans.  More specifically, each lesson plan will have a learning goal, prior knowledge activity, direct instruction, and problem-based activity for students to complete both independently and in-groups.  All non-essential information will be reflected on and removed, prior to instruction.  The signaling Principle will be used throughout the lessons to emphasize the lesson's learning goal.  The Redundancy Principle will be utilized during direct instruction, as all slideshow presentations will have accompanying audio via the instructor.  Slideshows will also adhere to the Modality Principle, which means the slideshows will utilize graphics and audio over graphics and text.  The Multimedia Principle also applies here, as graphics and words will be utilized over sole usage of words.  As presentations are created, spatial contiguity will be utilized by labeling diagrams next to their respective positions on the diagrams.  Temporal contiguity will be adhered to as the direct instruction occurs, so that the audio and visual components of instruction match up.  As seen with the 15 minutes or less direct instruction time, the  Segmentation Principle will be followed.  The Daily Do Now prior knowledge instructional strategy will satisfy the Pre-Training Principle.  The Personalization Principle will be utilized as the instructor conducts formative assessments, and checks in with students as they work on the daily problem.  As this is a live class,  the Preliminary considerations will be met, as seen with a live voice, instead of a computerized tone.

Regarding the topic of making this course an inclusive classroom to address the digital divide, there are important influences to consider.  The Title I high school is located in rural California, and has a student population of 75% Latino.  Based on that, there is no assumption that students have capable technology at home, and so the course is structured to have all work done in the classroom.  If students are able and would like to continue learning computer science at home, they are promoted to do so; however, those that cannot, will not be punished for their socioeconomic situation.  This is why the high school has provided Chromebooks to each student.  I have tried to plan for software usage that is especially cheap and easy for the school to implement, and the Title I designation is a big reason for that.  Given that this high school is located in a farming town, computer science is new to most students who will take the class.  This forces instruction to take a zero principles approach, which will benefit all students regardless of sex, gender, or race.  There are numerous examples of notable computer scientists across all demographics, and these figures will be introduced to the students to relate to their cultural needs.  This is also a way that I can address the issue of broadening participation.  I primarily teach chemistry, and am familiar with inquiry-based strategies, problem-based learning, and POGIL, all which emphasize the collaborative aspect of learning.  These principles will be able to be translated over to the computer science classroom easily.  The NGSS-based science classroom promotes cross-disciplinary activities, and this will be seen in this classroom as well.


### Impacts

The course described above demonstrates planning an inclusive and collaborative computer science classroom.  Due to the demographic, cultural, and socioeconomic context of this high school, I assume nothing as an educator.  I use evidence-based instructional strategies to incorporate prior knowledge, limit time of direct instruction, and deep learning through collaboration.  The technology required for this class is very reasonable, and takes into consideration the Title I designation of the high school.  In regards to class resiliency, Google Classroom and/or Canvas make transitioning to virtual learning simple.  Schedules, assignments, rubrics, and scaffolds will be posted regularly.  Transitoning to virtual learning would just need to incorporate Google Meet.  Since this course is catered to students interested in professional STEM careers, we will be following evolving course contexts.

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
